Hi, welcome to Digital Nomad Stories, the podcast. My name is Anne Klasse and I am your host. I started this podcast because podcasts have literally changed my life. Because of podcasts that I listened to years ago, I realized it is possible to live as a digital nomad, travel the world while working remotely. I since have started my own business and I travel the world. I am living the dream and I want to share my story but also the stories of other digital nomads with you so that hopefully you get inspired and chase your dreams as well. Okay, let's go. Hello, hello, Digital Nomads. Thank you so much for listening to this new episode of Digital Nomad Stories, the podcast. Today I am here with Dallas, the Privacy Postmaster from PrivacyPost.io. He was on the podcast before to talk about his move to Portugal, his own Digital Nomad Story and also about Privacy Post and he is back today to tell us more about Portugal. So in this episode, we're going to talk about why Portugal is a great way, a great gateway to go into the rest of Europe and also how you can get residency in Portugal. Definitely stay tuned for that. I know many, many people have questions about this. First of all, Dallas, welcome back to the podcast. Hello, Ana. Thank you. It's exciting to be back again. Yes. So also, if you're interested in the rest of Dallas's story, then go to the show notes because we'll link that first episode that we recorded together there. So then today we can go straight into Portugal. So Dallas, you live in Portugal at the moment, or Portugal is a home base, maybe? Yes, that's a very good way to put it. It is a primary hub or a home base for me in Europe. Absolutely. So my first question would be why Portugal? OK, for a while, that could be answered like why Portugal for me or why I think Portugal, if I were to sell Portugal for other people who are looking to become more international to change countries, whether it can be any country you're from. But if you are really looking for a Western country with modern services, modern infrastructure, safe, a good legal system, low crime, people that are fairly honest and multiple languages are spoken, of course, the primary would be English as a communal language that people, no matter where you're from, usually the common language would be English to speak in a group of people. Yeah. And very welcoming. I think the other thing would be Portugal being very welcoming to foreigners, to foreign investments, foreign people that are coming here to establish some type of residency or establishes as a primary place for them to to call home. They have created, especially since the banking crisis back, what, 10 years ago. So they really realize that they need to attract people here and they need to make it as easy and friendly and welcoming as possible. And they're one of the few countries in the EU that are like that. So there you go. Exactly. Because getting into the EU, I know like I never knew this before I started traveling, right, because I'm European, I'm from the Netherlands. But I realized that for a lot of people, it is really difficult to spend more than three months in the Schengen area. So Portugal could be a way to do that. Right. Can you tell us more about that? Yeah. So here's the deal. Like, I have quite a few people that just anecdotally say or comment or other podcasts I've been a guest on the host say, well, Portugal's not Portugal's too cliche. You know, I'm not into Portugal. I'm into the French Riviera. I'm a Parisian. And I'm, you know, and what I say to say to people is you don't have to have an affinity and you don't you don't choose Portugal. You don't have to choose Portugal and say, OK, I can't I can't leave Portugal. I'm going to be in Portugal now for the rest of my time here in Europe. You can create that as an entry point and a base, a home base for the rest of Europe. An example, I have a customer who we're just finalizing some some options for them. This is an awesome story and not a story, but like a situation I would love to be in someday. They have their international. They are now residents. They do have residency in Europe, but they're not Europeans. They have an auto caravan. And that's what an RV for Southern people. That's what I don't know what they call it up in your neck of the woods there, Anna, but it's an auto caravan, basically, you know, a small RV here in in Europe. And they purchased it. They did their research and they found what country is the easiest to be a non, you know, a non-citizen to purchase, register, maintain an auto caravan. And they found it was to be Portugal. So they came to Portugal. They made their their purchase. They are, you know, they're financially independent. I wouldn't say they're millionaires or anything like that, but they're financially independent. So they wanted some privacy. They wanted some kind of like, you know, just kind of keep it under the radar a little bit. And they were able to do that in Portugal. And they have it parked here. And once or twice a year, they come for a month or so and fly into Lisbon and hop in their auto caravan and just travel freely through Europe. And just what an awesome and amazing experience to be able to have that. So that is one of the examples of why people can choose Portugal. And if people love it here and they want to make this their home, primary home base in Europe, that's another that's another example and a reason to do it. But you don't have to have, you know, pledge your allegiance to, you know, the national football team of Portugal to say that this is going to be my hub or my spot for my EU, you know, residency. Exactly. I mean, I had exactly that when we got an apartment in Germany, actually, I was like, but then that means I have to be in Germany all the time. I don't want to be in Germany all the time. But then I realized like, oh, wait, this is a home base. We can still travel. So that's the same in Portugal. You can have your home there and then just travel through Europe and it makes it so much easier. And you can just take a train, take a cheap flight if that is available. Maybe not, maybe not as cheap as it was. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Let's do a little let's talk a little hack here, because we like to provide tools and resources for your listeners. Right. So if you are saying like, ah, you know, I could maybe want to check out Portugal, but I really, you know, I'm into Greece or I'm in Italy or whatever. What you can do is go to tap air dot PT, whatever you'll figure it out when you do your search up, go to tap air and you'll see when you search for flights, you can do the similar thing that Iceland does. They do that here now where tap air does to attract people into Portugal and to help their national airline with all the covid recovery and stuff. You can you can click layover and they will provide you a five day layover in Lisbon and then a huge not a huge, but it's a significant discount, a few a couple hundred euros discount to your final destination. So you can for wherever you're coming from, your origin outside of the EU, you come into Lisbon, you stay here for five days. So you collect all your baggage and everything. You stay here five days and then you're off to Spain, Madrid, Barcelona, Greece, Italy. They probably optimize for the market where they would promote this the most. But where I have a lot of customers tell me is what they do. And this is how I learned about this is their final destination is Lisbon. So they book something like, oh, my final destination is going to be Barcelona. They save two, three hundred dollars euro on their flight. But they stay here. They don't they don't take the last leg of the flight. And I'm like, well, what about your baggage? And like, well, we're here for five days. We have to collect everything. So it's like they it's it's a brilliant strategy and plan. So that's something to just to leverage if Portugal is not going to be your your your final destination. You can leverage that, you know, to to get to your other destination around Europe. That is a great hack. I'm so going to use that. That is perfect. Thank you so much for sharing that. I'm sure everyone is now going to be like, oh, where can I go with my five day layover in Lisbon and then onward somewhere else? That is awesome. So let's say that we do want a home base in Portugal. And Portugal is awesome, by the way. I think so. What are some of the best places that you find to live in Portugal or to have that home base? Right. So the overwhelming majority of the people and for me as well, like right now, I am looking at the tag that empties into the the Atlantic and the the when the sky is blue, the water is bluer. It looks like the Mediterranean, you know, in those picture postcards. So people typically want to be near the ocean. They want to be in the in the ocean cities everywhere from, you know, Porto down all the way to the Algarve. So it's really, boy, it's it's a mixed bag. A lot of people when they want to, you know, a lot of people, though, because they think they want it, but because they read it or they visited about it is Caxcaix, which is I call it the city of exiles. It has an awesome history. It used to be a summer community for the wealthies and the royalty outside of Lisbon. That is a wonderful, very Eurocentric, international city to to call your home very expensive as well. But I would say Lisbon, Caxcaix, all the way down into the Algarve, you've got Lulei, Almancil, Lagos. Some people love to get into the the coastal area of Alentejo that's between Lisbon and the Algarve. And there's some beautiful beaches and beautiful villages or cities in that are not that touristy in that area. And then a lot of people like Laita, which is just an hour or so. Eiriceira, both Eiriceira is like I call it the mini San Diego of of Portugal, where it's a very beach community and surfing community. So it's really all over the place. People really like to gravitate towards, again, towards the coasts and really take advantage of the beaches and the sand and the kind of the beach community. Yeah, that sounds really good. So there's actually something for everyone, especially when you love the beach. But then there's the bigger cities, but also like the smaller towns, the beach vibes, like the surfer community, like it's all there. Yes. Now, a lot of people, not a lot. But a lot of people are like, you know, I want to be I want to be surrounded by the culture, the old part of Portugal and so forth. And you can go into the interior for that. And people will go into the mountains. You know, the Piotr is a really touristic, beautiful, small city that they don't they don't. Yeah, they don't have Internet there. They have very few cars. But, you know, people in that but in that region there around the mountain range here in Portugal. Yeah, people will go in there and they'll really experience the old school, the ancient. I was in Luriga in the in that in that region, in the mountain region of the interior. And it's so cool. And maybe this is for Europeans. It's kind of like you see one castle, you see them all. So it's like not that big of a deal. But they've got a bridge that was built by the Romans, you know, in the you know, in like, you know, the first century of B.C. or A.D. It's just it's crazy to think you're walking on a bridge that has been here for like almost 2000 years. You know, it's just it's it's incredible. It's crazy. But it's it is very cool. So yeah. So there you go. Yeah. So I hear a lot of weekend trips also. So let's say you you have your home base in Lisbon, as probably most remote workers do, then I think you can do weekend trips for a year. And there's still new things. Yes. Yeah. It's so funny. You know, when you go to Lisbon, you say to someone who's local here or Portuguese, hey, you know, I'm going to go let's go let's go zip up to Porto for the weekend. And they're like, oh, my gosh, that is such a that is a journey. No, that's going to take. And you're like, well, how long? It's three hours. And I was like, what? I mean, being an American and driving in the U.S., I mean, that that's like that's a that's a jaunt for us, you know, to drive. Let's go into the grocery store. Let's go to the grocery store. Yeah. So really, yeah. In the whole country, you could probably drive the whole country easily in six hours from north to south. I'm kind of guessing there, but I would say probably because it's maybe a little longer as far to Porto. It's three hours and down to the Algarve. It's a little under three hours from Lisbon. So really, Lisbon geographically can be a central point if you want to zip down or take the train. They got some great train service down to the Algarve. They got great train service up to Porto. Interior is a little more limited, a little more challenging somewhere in the central beach communities, a little more challenging. You'd have to take a bus. They don't have the trains that go up and down the coasts of the central Atlantic coast. But yeah, lots to do and lots to see. Yes. OK, so we're sold. We're going to go to Portugal. What are the requirements for this D7 visa? OK, so this is a hot topic, not only with Americans. There's a lot. And it really there's been a couple of a few articles lately about, you know, the the attraction to Portugal. And I don't remember the specific numbers, but I was really surprised that the number of Americans was, you know, as an American, we become egocentric and we think are all the people coming here for their residency are Americans. But really, it's not. It's a smaller percentage. But there was so the requirements doesn't matter what country you're from. The requirements are the same. And typically, most people do a D7. A D7 means your income comes from somewhere outside of Portugal. You are a digital nomad. You've got a full time job in another country. And a lot of people get confused. I think that's just for pensioners, just for people that are on a retirement income. It does not know that is not the case at all. So with a D7, it can be pension. It can be a retirement income. It can be Social Security, but also can be a job that's outside of Portugal. So the key with this and what makes it easier, easy to get the DS easier, there's less friction to get a D7 is you're not coming into the country to take jobs. You're not coming in the country looking for work, increasing the employment seeker pool. You're not coming here because you need benefits or you're not going to then take advantage of the benefits as someone who doesn't have a job, doesn't have a home, blah, blah, blah. So that's what people do is a D7. So with a D7, there's many requirements. The list is pretty long, but don't get overwhelmed with the list. Really, what you have to do is kind of divide and conquer, take care of your low-hanging fruit on the list. VFS, the Victor Frank Sierra, is the service that as many countries, Portugal has contracted out to take care of the beginning legwork of the application process. Their website is very clear on, you have to click through to get to the link to where you get your list from of the requirements. But they give you a pretty comprehensive list of the requirements, but it also can be very vague. But so to talk about, do you want me to talk a little bit about the hurdles of that list and what really kind of get people hung up on doing this? Yes. Sounds good. Okay. Yeah. So the hurdles of the list are, the number one hurdle, the first step is you need to have a financial number in Portugal. Basically we would call that in the US, almost like a social security number. A tax identification number would be another good example. And you need this, it's called a NIF, N-I-F, or in Portuguese it's called a Contrabunt. And it don't get freaked out in many other countries. This is not a secret number that people could hack you and you can't, that you have to keep hidden and so forth. It's a very public number and you give it to every time you go to a store and you want to get a purchase associated to your taxes, people blurt out their NIF all the time in stores or whatever. So it's not really that private, but you do need this and there's certain requirements and it's kind of long to get into what those requirements are. Most people go to a website, it's a startup website. I think some digital nomads created the website. It's very straightforward, very easy. It is an option for doing the NIF. It's about 150 euro, everywhere is about the same price, 150 euro. I personally don't recommend doing things online, whether it's that service or another service, because of my centric, my priorities on privacy, you are uploading a lot of personal data and you are doing a lot of things digitally, virtually, and you're not building those key relationships that we'll hopefully get to here in the next 20 minutes. So you're doing things virtually and you're not really creating that bridge to remove some of the frictions of doing this, but you can do that for 150 euro. They will then work with another third party in Portugal and get you that NIF. That's one option. Another option, which I recommend is go through an advogado, a lawyer here in Portugal for the same price. They will do all this for you. There's many Facebook groups for expats in Portugal or digital, whatever those groups are, I'm not in them. So I don't know the specific names. It's easy to find them, but they can give you resources or people are on there that will advise or provide their resources to be a boots on the ground, get your NIF for you and you work directly with them. So that's your first obstacle. Because once you get the NIF, then you need the next one. Next obstacle or hurdle is a bank account. You need a Portuguese bank account. You can't use Wise. You can't use Revolut. You have to have a Portugal bank account and it has to, the IBAN has to start with PT. So you need a NIF for that and you need a bunch of other paperwork. It's a challenge to do it from the US, but you can do it from, or any country outside of Portugal. You can do it virtually. There are some banks like Atlantico that will do it. They have a virtual service. However, it's, it's, it can be really a challenge doing it virtually, but you can do it virtually. What I recommend again is get an Advocado or we also do the same. We also do the same with the NIF is we become the power of attorney and Advocado becomes the power of attorney and they are the representative to get your bank account here in Portugal. And it takes all, it takes care of a lot of the headache and people are like, oh, I can't let, you know, some stranger be, have access to my account. And they've got this down pat here in Portugal. You have the power of attorney is very specific and it is extremely limited. They can only create the account under your name. They can't transfer money. They can't, they can't deposit money into it. They can't close the account. They can only create it. The account really does not become active until this person immigrates or moves to Portugal. And then they go in and sign the final documents really is all it does is provides the proof that you've established a bank account in Portugal and you've moved the required funds into that account to support you while you're there. you're here. So those are some of the two bigger hurdles. The hugest hurdle of so far of the three is accommodations, housing. When you say that you're going to make Portugal your home base or your hub for Europe and you say, I'm going to start my residency here in Portugal, you need to have proof of accommodations for a year. Now, it used to be that people would just get an Airbnb, they just get an Airbnb reservation, sometimes maybe even a hotel and say, OK, here's my reservation. They may cancel it or change it once they get their stamp to come to Portugal. Those still do happen, but a lot of times they get rejected. So you actually need a physical lease for accommodations for an apartment. Doing that remote and from abroad is a huge challenge and requires a lot of trust in the person that you're making a commitment to if the property really does exist or if you get there and there's three other people that have they've sold a lease to and all these other nightmares you hear about, which are true. So really, the housing, there is a big housing crunch here in Portugal because of the demand, but also because of the war in Ukraine and in East Europe, Northeast Europe. There's a lot of not refugees, but dislocated people, temporary refugees here that are looking for housing and they have qualified incomes and so forth. So they are competing with the good housing along everybody along with everybody else that is wanting to move and call this their home. So really, you cannot get your stamp to come to Portugal to start your residency process until you have some accommodations that are solidified and certified and meet the requirements for that process. That is really where people are. People are down to the wire. They're like stressing out because oh my gosh, I have my VFS appointment in whatever country for my stamp and I don't have a lease yet. What do I do? Nobody returns my phone calls. Nobody returns my emails. My agents aren't helping me. And it is a stress point in the whole process. And then lastly, this is just more of a considerable, this is just an honorable mention is health care. You need to have some type of health insurance policy so that you don't come here and like, oh, I need to have the public health take care of me. You need to show some kind of health care that you've, some kind of temporary travel policy or something like that. Some people do the world health care policy, which is very expensive, like 300, at least three or $600 a month. We find that people can just do a travel insurance where they could be expatriated back to their home country. So those are just like, you get three months for like $100 or whatever. The dates are floating. So you're not committed to a certain date of time that would expire if your timelines shift on your process. So we recommend that, but back that up with your home insurance policy plan and attach that to this. Yes, I have good health care insurance in my home country and I have a policy to expatriate me to my home country if I get in a pickle in Portugal. So those are the some key points. So, yeah, so that's a lot. Yeah, I think this is super helpful. Yeah, it's a lot of paperwork, right? Can people also do this while already in Portugal or do you have to do this from your home country? Yeah, great question. Okay, so I'm a rule breaker. I did it while I was here, but they don't recommend that. I did everything here and I'm telling you, Ana, there is nothing more frightening or trusting than taking your passport while you're abroad and putting it into a FedEx mailer and sending it back to the US. I mean, this is so counterintuitive. Wait, I'm sending my passport, my US passport from Portugal to the US, spending $100, 100 euro to get it there and hoping it gets there and then spending another hundred plus to get it back. So, yes, you can. We could guide people through that if they really want to take on that adventure, but it is a little trickier and they're less encouraging of that. But you can do it. Yes, you can. Most people follow the Facebook groups. The Facebook groups are very literal and say you can't do that. Don't do that. It's not advised. I don't advise against either, but people are in that situation, you know, and so it can work. OK, OK, that's good to know. So how do you help clients in getting this visa? You know, I would just listen to our other episode that we did like late mid late December. And I'm like, was that six months ago or was that like six years ago? I mean, so much has changed in the last six months. It's just amazing how, you know, when you start a business and it evolves and you think you have one plan and one destination and it just takes a little bit, not maybe a detour a little bit or it just it goes a little bit of it. It doesn't do a complete reboot, but it kind of goes in the direction where there's more need, more demand and so forth. And I've always had a vision when I did make privacy post in the US for virtual mail services, for international people going into the US to create, you know, a presence and also for Americans who are then going to travel international. But I also wanted to do is because I'm in my process of getting my passport in Portugal. And so the way I'm doing it, you have to spend more time here. So I'm kind of more committed to here. I'm like, well, how can I how can I develop my business from the US and also here? So I have revenue coming in from Portugal. So I'm like, duh. I mean, I've done the D7 process. I've helped so many other people free help as as as digital nomads and friends and family and stuff with the D7. I'm like, why don't I make it a service? And so I provide assistance with the D7. But my strategy, my plan and our plan is much different than this typical. We are very hands on, high touch, innovative, not necessarily break the rules fraudulently, but we find creative resources to be able to get through the process and do an offer services that no other of the service offers. An example of that is back to the biggest challenge. The hurdle is accommodations and housing. We have special apartments that we lease to D7 residency folks that are in the process of the D7. And we do things very uniquely. It has been it has gone through full legal review with with advocados here in Portugal and everything is on the up the up and structured. So it would minimize the rejection from the process. OK, I'm not guaranteeing it, because sometimes it's like everybody has a different experience. And one regulator or bureaucrat that's doing it can be more picky than the other. But we minimize as much as possible the friction to getting your D7 residency card. So what we do is we have accommodations here. We have apartments here, T1s and T2s, one and two bedrooms here in Portugal. And what these are are very special leases. It is a 12 month lease to meet the requirements for the residency. But it gives you a 90 day out clause in that lease. So you can come into Portugal, get that that lease, that physical piece of paper that meets the requirements. You can submit that in for either your D7 stamp in your other country or once you get you have your D7 stamp and then you're in Portugal for that next step of actually applying for your residency card. You then have to supply that again. You can use that for either of those. It gets you three months into the country to be able to really check things out. Where do I want to move? What what neighborhood? Even if you say I want to live in Caxcaix, but I don't know what neighborhood I want to live in. Everybody thinks they want to be in city center. They want to be in all the activity and the vibe and everything. And then they spend two weeks in the city center. They're like, get me out. And so this gives the opportunity to go to D.C. We do have accommodations at T1 in Caxcaix. And it gives people the opportunity to get to a region, to get to an area and give them solid three months. Because even if you come and you know this, Ana, when you even if you spend a few weeks in a location, you kind of like when you're on your honeymoon period of dating, you only focus on the beautiful things and the good things for that other person. You see everything through rose colored glasses. Right. And when we are traveling for a shorter period of time around the world, we see things in a different we see things in a different light. And then when you spend longer, they're like, why did I choose this? Or why was I attracted to this person? Was I crazy? And the same thing is. So this gives people the opportunity to be able to really get to know their community. And if this is really where they want to call home. The other thing of which I really impressed, we talked a little bit in the beginning of the call is it's really important. Here's another kind of a hack. It's common sense for us old school people. But really, if you want to move to another country and this is really applies to any country in the world. If you want to relocate or move to another country or travel to another country and kind of establish some some level of roots or presence in that country, you need to learn the culture. You need to meet people. You need to shake hands. You need to build trust with locals. If you come to a country like, for example, just you come to Portugal and you spend all your time in the digital nomad meetups. If you only spend all your time in the Facebook groups, if you spend all your time on ideally show, which is the website that's very common here in southern Europe for housing and you just send, you know, 500 requests in a can statement that I want to see the property, I want to see the property. You don't have any personal profile. You leave no personal message like, hey, this is my situation. This is my qualifying income. And you just I can't find any. I don't have any resources here. I can't find a place to live. I don't know. I don't know the right communities to go to. You need to meet local people. They can be residents. They can be expats, but they have residents. They have commit. They have they have ties to the community. That's really key. You need to do that. If you just stay in this this bubble or vacuum of the digital nomad world, you'll be stuck there and you'll be very frustrated. You will feel like you don't belong here because nobody will will return your emails or so forth. So it's really important to to make those ties and commit to connections as any country in the world. I think outside of more of the developed countries, so many things are on not only referral, but a local person said, yeah, I know this person and I trust them and you should trust them, too. People do not, especially in Portugal. They do not like to deal or trust with foreigners. They I don't think it's like, oh, I don't deal with this certain country of foreigners. You know, it's like all foreigners. It doesn't matter what country you're from. They are suspicious. They are hesitant. They are cautious with foreigners because they don't have roots here. They can say, yeah, I want your place for a year and then quit paying their rent and three months later disappear and never see your money again. You know, and so it is tough for to fight housing and the requirements and the financial requirements because of that. You get in with the right people. You make you make connections or relation and genuineness, not fake ones like, hey, if I do this for you, will you do this for me? You really have to make genuine, authentic connections with people and you will get much farther in in your journey and your quest to whatever your your strategy is. Exactly. It's all about the relationships. It's all about the network that you have. Absolutely. And it's not, you know, I say that to people and they're like, oh, yeah, it's not what you know, it's who you know. And it's like that's a very negative way to look at it. It's not like you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours. Not at all. It's about building trust. And I'll tell you this, Anna, here in anecdotal from, you know, I talked to a lot of people about housing here in Portugal and even Portuguese. And I was talking as I was at a coworking space and the in the office manager, we were talking and she's Portuguese and we were talking about her last experience and she grew up, lived in Lisbon. She is totally 100 percent Portuguese. And her and her boyfriend were moving to Graca. That's a wonderful old community in Lisbon. It was a senior man that owned the property probably owned. He probably was given to him from his parents. And he sat down. He says, OK, tell me about who are you? Where did you go to school? Who is your parents? What is your parents last name? Where did they go to school? Where do they work? I would like to meet your boyfriend, your partner. You know, what does he do? What were who were his parents? It's all about the ties to the community and the relationships. And even in Portugal goes to another level. If you go to it, I like I was trying to get some property in Castelo Branco in the interior. They didn't want nothing to do with me because I'm a foreigner. And I learned that even within the interior in other countries, it's like not only are you at a disadvantage if you're a foreigner, but if you're not within that region. They don't want to deal with people from Lisbon. They're like, oh, you're you're from the big city. I don't trust you. I don't want to deal with you. Even if you're 100 percent Portuguese and you're from Lisbon, you can go to some of these smaller towns and they'll say, no, I don't want to deal with you. I want to deal with locals, locals only. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's like like you said, it's all about the trust. If you don't have trust, it just becomes really difficult. And the cool thing is that you already have relationships there. You have the properties that you can help people with housing. So it's just it's just an easier way, a way easier way to get this visa. Yes. And I have built the trust through it. It has taken time. I've built the trust with with agents and property owners here that trust me. And then if it is not their property, they can go to another property and say, you know, I've been working with this Dallas guy. Yes, he's a foreigner, but I trust him. He has taken care of my properties and my clients. And I think you can trust him to getting on the right side of an agent. An agent can be the gatekeeper. So you really need to establish relationships and trust with even the agent if the agent is just representing the property. That's key. Going on idealista. And just sending, like I said, a thousand requests to see a property in a can statement. I'm on idealista on my properties and I was just looking before this call and I listed one of my properties a little over a week ago. I have over 100 inquiries in it. I don't even look at the can statements because I show the availability of the property and they want to see it tomorrow and move in next week. And if they're not even reading the description of the property and the description is 140 words or less, it's not this big long thing. If they're not reading it and they're just sending this can request, they've probably done it to 500 other ones. And if I even, if I respond to them and give them my undivided attention, they probably flake out and I'll never hear from them again. So I just delete them. I don't even look at them. Exactly. Yeah. When you send these, also think about the other side, like how is that situation? Yeah. If you get a hundred or more of these replies, then of course they're not going to pick yours if it's just a copy paste. Thank you so much for this episode. I learned a lot about relocating to Portugal. I think this is super, super valuable for so many people who are considering coming to Europe for a longer time. If people want to know more, I think privacypost.io. Yes. We are spinning up Lusitano Dreams for specifically for Portugal, but that is in process, but yes, privacypost.io will get you everything you need to know. Also, you'll see our postings on Idealista because they just say D7 apartment, D7 properties. I put D7 in the kind of, not the headline, you can't do that, but in the description. And really quick, do we have one minute to just really overemphasize and stress what we're talking about here? Things are evolving. Three years ago before COVID, people could have more of the digital, the cliche digital nomad life. They could get it on an easy jet for 12 euro and go to the other side of Europe and spend a month there or whatever. Countries around the world, I have several clients in Asia and in South America, Latin America, who are like, they're shuffled. They're going across the border for a night and coming back. Those grease in the palms of a local to get your visa extended. Those things, people are not working anymore. Traveling is getting more expensive. There's less flights. Making a last minute flight, there's just everything. Things are evolving and changing. It's kind of becoming a new world. And so I highly recommend creating a hub and spoke, having certain parts of the world. If you like a region or a continent in the world, determine a hub and spoke and plant a flag, have resources there. So you're not across the world. If there's another virus or another lockdown or something, you have some place, a kind of a safe house or a community that you can go to. My cell is Portugal is Europe. Right. I think that is just really smart. It's just in today's world, that's just what you're going to do to make sure that you can keep traveling, that you can go to different places. You just, like you said, you plant your flag there and then that's what I call it. Home base. Yes. Thank you so much, Dallas, for sharing your story and for sharing these hacks with us. I mean, I also learned a lot from like doing the flights and then going to a Portugal website and then do it like a five day layover. That sounds perfect. Like, yes, I'm literally going to do that. OK. OK. Thanks, Anna, for your time, too. Thank you so much. And thank you for listening. I'll see you next week. And that's it for today. Thank you so much for listening.
